# Eratosthen primes generating tool
This is a tool that implements several Eratosthen algorithms of generating prime numbers.
It can generate prime numbers in a range specified in command line.

## Command line arguments
```
Eratosthen usage:
-o, --optimum    <outfiletype> <start> <length> Generates primes using optimized Eratosthen sieve mode.
                 Store generates primes in a file of <outfiletype> type.
-6, --6n1        <outfiletype> <start> <length> Generates primes using 6n1 Eratosthen sieve mode
                 (faster, uses less memory).
-30, --30nx      <outfiletype> <start> <length> Generates primes using 30nx Eratosthen sieve mode
                 (even more faster, uses less memory than 6n1).
-s, --simple     <outfiletype> <start> <length> Generates primes using simplest Eratosthen sieve mode.
-p, --primesfile <filename> File with primes to preload, if not specified then default file 'primes - 0-1G.diffvar.bin' is used.
                            File is looked in the same folder with Eratosthen.exe file.
-t, --threads    <threads>  Use specified number of threads during primes checking. If not specified, single thread used. 
-h, --help                  Show this help
```
You should specify one of these options ```-s```, ```-o```, ```-6```, ```-30``` to generate prime numbers. All other options optional.
All three arguments of these options must be specified. There are no default values for them.

## Prime generating modes
There are several primes generating modes: simple (```-s```), optimized (```-o```), 6n1 (```-6```) and 30nx (```-30```).
Eratosthen algorithm itself requires much memory for execution.
Simple mode is a straightforward and simple implementation of Eratosthen algorithm.
Optimized mode requires about two times less memory than simple mode because it excludes even numbers from consideration.
6n1 mode uses fact that any prime number may have only reminders either 1 or 5 when dividing by 6. 
It does not store numbers that have other reminders. This way it saves memory.
30nx this is extension of 6n1 mode to divider 30. It uses even less memory than 6n1 and slightly faster then 6n1.

## Output file type
Generated primes numbers can be stored into 5 different file formats. 
You can specify any suitable for you format in command line.

Supported formats: txt, txtdiff, bin, bindiff, bindiffvar.
- ```txt``` - standard txt format where all prime numbers are stored as comma separated decimal numbers and can be easily viewed in notepad. Files of this format have the biggest size.
- ```txtdiff``` - this is also text format that can be viewed in notepad. Each prime number starting from second is written as difference with previous one. First prime number is written as is. 
That allows to make output file much smaller. It becomes especially important is you need to generate big primes number and in a big range (let say 100G range or even more).
- ```bin``` - numbers are stored in binary format. Each prime number in a file takes exacly 8 bytes (long long in C++). To work with this format you probably need to write your code to read this format. This is easy. 
Please pay attention that some other programming languages and/or platforms may use other sequence of bytes when saving/reading binary integers from file. 
- ```bindiff``` - idea is the same as .txtdiff but in binary format. Only 2 bytes (short type in C++) instead of 8 are used for saving diff values. It makes bindiff file four times smaller than .bin file.
- ```bindiffvar``` - main idea is the following: prime numbers usually stay not too far from each other. For even really big numbers (but numbers that fit into C++ long long type) maximum distance between two consequitive primes did not exceed 800 in all checked cases. 
Is most cases distance is even less than 255. It means that if distance is less than 255 we can code this difference with 1 byte, and only for rare cases when the difference is larger than 255 we can code such value with 2 bytes. 
In addition to above, distance between two primes numbers is always even. So we can store diff/2 instead of diff. 
That idea allows us to create even more 'compressed' format of storing such numbers. ```bindiffvar``` format uses 'variable length' coding to store difference between two consequitive primes numbers.
it makes file with primes numbers 10 times smaller size than txt format.

To specify file format use predefined names: txt, txtdiff, bindiff, bindiffvar as the first argument (<outfiletype>) of ```-o```, ```-s```, ```-6```, and ```-30``` options.

## Start and Length parameters
Second and third arguments define START and LENGTH range parameters for generating primes.
You can use factor modificators (case insensitive) to make it more convenient to define range. <br>
B - bytes

K - kilobytes

M - megabytes

G - gigabytes

T - terabytes

P - petabytes

Examples for command lines arguments:
```
Erastofen.exe -s txt 0B 10g           - 'simple' mode, txt file format, seeks primes in a range 0...10G 
Erastofen.exe -o bin 900G 100G        - 'optimised' mode, bin file format, seeks primes from 900G to 1000G
Erastofen.exe -o txtdif 100T 10G      - 'optimised' mode, txtdiff file format, seeks primes from 100 terabytes =100'000'000'000'000 to 100T+10G =100'010'000'000'000
Erastofen.exe -6 bindiff 5T 50g       - 'simple' mode, bindiff file format, START=5T and LENGTH=50G (5T...5T+50G)
Erastofen.exe -o bindiffvar 20P 1G    - 'optimised' mode, bindiffvar file format, START=20T and LENGTH=1G
Erastofen.exe -t 5 -o bindiffvar 20P 1G  - the same as above but primes generation will be performed in 4 threads + 1 main and controling thread. Total is 5.
Erastofen.exe -t 5 -p "primes - 3G.diffvar.bin" -o bindiffvar 20P 1G   - the same as above but primes will be preloaded from specified file instead of default one.
Erastofen.exe -30 0P 1G                - if you would like to generate primes starting from zero you can use any modificator for START argument. Value without modificator will generate an error.
```
## Options ```threads``` and ```primesfile```
It is possible to do primes generation in several threads.
Specify option ```-t``` followed by number of threads you need.
Number of threads can be between 1 and 24.
Please note that N threads do not increase speed in N times because of synchronization expenses.

```Eratosthen.exe``` uses pre-generated prime numbers for calculation other primes.
Pre-generated prime numbers are stored in ```primes - 0-1G.diffvar.bin``` file that is used by default.
Pre-generated prime numbers of 0-1G range allow us to generate other prime numbers from 1G to 1e18.

If you would like to use another file with pre-generated prime numbers you can use option ```-p``` to tell ```Eratosthen.exe``` to read primes from that file.
